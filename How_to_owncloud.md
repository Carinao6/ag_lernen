# Cloud computing system supported by Charit√© IT

Instead of using dropbox we have owncloud for file sharing. 

# How to get access to Own cloud

send an email to jakob.kaminski@charite.de (who takes care of owncloud for AG Lernen) requesting access to owncloud

Install the client on C:/ should possible without admin rights, if not there ask IT to install it!

Set owncloud folder to T:/ if to small ask IT to increase quota.
